## Running 

npm start 

## Install 
- npm install -g typescript 

Ts compiles to JS 

- tsc app.ts  -> creates app.js which can be loaded in index.html

Ts adds:  

- Types 
- Better autocompletes 
- Next gen js features compiled down for older browsers (like babel)
- Non js like interfaces and generics 
- Meta programming like decorators 
- Rich configurations options
- Get support in non Ts projects 

## TS Basics 

Javascript uses "dynamic types" (resolved at runtime), TS yses "static types" (resolved during development). 

Good Practice : 

- let number1: number; (non initialized variable must have its type)

Bad Practice : 

const number1: number = 5; (unneeded)

Core Types : 

- number (all number formats)
- string (all ticks)
- boolean (just true e false) 

Important: Type Casing
In TypeScript, you work with types like string or number all the times.

Important: It is string and number (etc.), NOT String, Number etc.

The core primitive types in TypeScript are all lowercase!
